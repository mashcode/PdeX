##Govlab proposal

**Team Name/Project Name:** PdeX (PDFdisrupt)

Please tell us about the problem your project addresses. Why is this problem important? What are the causes of the problem you wish to tackle? (Team members can use the same response) *

Think about it. What's the one thing that prevents change in government? Fear of the unknown or "the devil you know" mindset...this much is obvious. In part human nature reinforced by law and glacial democratic churn. 

Simply put, the current PDF delivery of data analysis "reports" is an albatross. The content locked inside these documents while sometimes text readable, is not machine ready, not easily reproducible, and therefore not trustworthy. It does not play nice with the fundamental idea behind open data nor does it make sense as a practical publishing platform.

Now that you've told us about the problem, tell us briefly about the project (team members can use the same response) *

Updating the machinery and workflows that produce the data content of city government is one thing but describing and selling it using open-source software and licensing needs incubation toward the development of MVPs, use-cases, proof of concept, alpha and beta releases. Using Jekyllrb as a project/page scaffolding, Discourse as metadata and ckan as data dashboard.

What is your hope for this project? What will be your definition of success? *

Success would be (by order of importance) starting a community of users with active input, blog and media posts telling the story, and finally producing a literate programming document using the PdeX model and publishing to a ckan data dashboard at data.beta.nyc.
